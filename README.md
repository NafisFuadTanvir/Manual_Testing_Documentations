# Project Overview 
This documentation details the manual testing  for a digital payment system, focusing on core functionalities such as customer bill payments (merchant and utility) and a loan application/repayment system. The aim is to ensure the system meets specified requirements, functions correctly, and provides a robust user experience.
# Key Features Tested

The testing covered the following primary features of the digital payment system:

• Customer Bill Payments (Merchant and Utility Bills): This feature allows customers to pay various merchants and utility bills, encompassing account validation, transaction fees, and cashback mechanisms.

• Loan Application and Repayment: This feature enables customers to apply for loans based on specific eligibility criteria, with defined rules for loan amounts, interest calculation, and re-loan eligibility.
